Digital Marketing Landing Page

A layout-focused landing page built as part of my CSS Grid practice.

📌 Project Overview

This project was created to strengthen my understanding of CSS Grid architecture and layout structuring.
The main focus was not visual perfection, but clean structure, predictable layout behavior, and proper separation of responsibilities between layout tools.

The design was implemented from a provided mockup as a desktop version.

🎯 Key Learning Goals

Building a page-level grid system

Creating nested grids inside sections

Using grid-column: span for card layouts

Understanding when to use Grid vs Flexbox

Separating layout, structure, and decorative elements

Proper container usage for width control

Managing UI states cleanly

🛠 Tech Stack

HTML5

CSS3

CSS Grid

Flexbox

Minimal JavaScript (navigation active state handling)

🧠 Architectural Approach

The layout follows a structured pattern:

Sections control background and vertical spacing

A container manages content width and horizontal alignment

CSS Grid handles structural layout

Flexbox is used for internal alignment and micro-layout

Decorative elements are positioned with absolute where appropriate

Some repeating components (like service cards) could be dynamically generated with JavaScript.
However, they were intentionally kept static in this version to clearly demonstrate grid structure and layout logic.

🚀 What This Project Demonstrates

Confident use of CSS Grid in real layout scenarios

Understanding of layout hierarchy

Clean separation between structure and styling

Thoughtful decision-making about when to use Grid, Flexbox, or minimal JS

📌 Status

Completed as part of a learning process.
Future improvements may include responsiveness and component refactoring.
